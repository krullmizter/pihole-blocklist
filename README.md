# Personal Pi-hole blocklist
#### Free to use

Just copy the raw blocklist.txt to your pi-holes dashboard under: Group Management ‚û°Ô∏è Adlists (remember to copy the raw version, not just the github page URL). You need to SSH in to the pihole and run `pihole -g` or update your piholes gravity list from within the dashboard to load all URLs to block.
